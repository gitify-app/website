When authenticating via **Personal Access Token (PAT)**:
- open [GitHub Developer Settings >> Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
- confirm that your PAT has the following recommended permissions: `notifications`, `read:user` and `repo`
- Note: if you only want Gitify to access public repositories, you can use permissions: `notifications`, `read:user` and `public_repo`

When authenticating via **Gitify GitHub App**:
- some organizations require GitHub Apps to request access prior to allowing access to organization data (including notifications)
- to check if Gitify is approved by your organization
  -  open [GitHub Developer Settings >> GitHub Apps](https://github.com/settings/applications)
  -  click on the _Gitify_ application
  -  under _Organization access_ verify that access has been granted for your organization.  
  -  If it hasn't, from here you can request your Organization Administrators to approve.
